# Meet Attendance Tracker Extension

This is a placeholder icon file. For production use, replace with actual icon images.

To create icons:
1. Create 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images
2. Save them as icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png in this directory
3. Use a simple attendance/calendar icon design

For now, the extension will work without icons (Chrome will show a default icon).
